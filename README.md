# Driver Design

## - This repo is a side project I'm working on to develop my driver design skills as well as implementing the TTA system and the OS corporative scheduler.

## - I'm using the atmega328p microcontroller programmed by an usbasp and a simple makefile.

# Resources:

- Atmga328p Datasheet
- Patterns for Time-Triggered Embedded Systems\_ Building Reliable Applications with the 8051 Family of Microcontrollers.
